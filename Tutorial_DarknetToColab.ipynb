        "* Train a **Yolo v3** model using **Darknet** using the Colab **12GB-RAM GPU**.\n",
        "* Turn Colab notebooks into an effective tool to work on real projects. Dealing with the handicap of a runtime that will **blow up every 12 hours** into the space!\n",
        "  * Working directly from the files on your computer.\n",
        "  * Configure your notebook to install everything you need and start training in about a minute (Tested using 550MB dataset).\n",
        "  * Receive your trained weights directly on your computer during the training. While the notebook is training you can check how it is going using your trained weights in your computer.\n",
